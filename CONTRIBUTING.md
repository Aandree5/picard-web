## üß© Creating Good Issues

- **Search first**: Check existing issues and discussions before opening a new one.
- **Be specific**: Include steps to reproduce, expected vs. actual behavior, and environment details.
- **Minimal examples**: When reporting bugs, providing the smallest reproducible case, if possible, helps to track down the issue.

## üîÄ Submitting Pull Requests

- **Branching**: Create a branch from `main` (e.g., `feat/add-logging`).

  - `docs:` for documentation changes
  - `chore:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, etc.
- **Small and focused**: Keep PRs limited to a single concern.
- **Linked issues**: Reference related issues in your PR description (e.g. `fixes #42`, `closes #42`, `ref #42`).
